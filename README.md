# Cypresstest

Cypress.io is a new javascript end-to end testing tool. Its fast, easy and awesome. I am getting addicted to this tool :). 
I will briefly explain the installation steps of Cypress.io testing tool.<br>
First I have installed node.js in my system: <br>
 #cd /your/project/path <br>
 #npm install cypress --save-dev <br>
 #cypress open <br>   
 
 If you want to run your tests in 'headless' mode: 
 #C:\MyFolder\Tests> C:\node_modules.bin\cypress run --headed --no-exit 'C:\MyFolder\Tests\cypress\integration\examples\test.js'
